# About
This project is a loan management system assigned by Commerce Bank. It uses SpringBoot for the backend which uses the Spring framework and H2 Database. 
The frontend is using the React javascript library to make the application dynamic and more user-friendly.

# What the application does:
This application allows a user to view their loans in a table format and loan details upon clicking the specified loan in the table. The user is also 
allowed to update their account information as well. There is also an admin role where they can view a table of all loans in the system and view each 
loan individually. The admin account can also add new loans and assign the loan to a specified customer.
